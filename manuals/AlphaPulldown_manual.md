# AlphaPulldown Manual

[add version]

AlphaPulldown is an implementation of [AlphaFold](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold) designed for customizable high-throughput screening of protein-protein interactions. Besides, AlphaPulldown provides additional customizations of the AlphaFold which include custom structural templates, MMseqs2 multiple sequence alignment (MSA), protein fragment predictions, and implementation of cross-link mass spec data using [AlphaLink2](https://github.com/Rappsilber-Laboratory/AlphaLink2/tree/main), [add Integrates experimental models into AlphaFold pipeline using custom multimeric databases].

The original AlphaFold-Multimer end-to-end protein complex prediction pipeline may be split into two main steps:

1) **Features generation** At this step for every protein queried protein sequence Alphafold predicts
